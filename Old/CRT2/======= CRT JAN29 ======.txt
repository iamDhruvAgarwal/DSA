BIT MANIPULATION
when the bits exceed 64 no. then we won't be able to convert binary to decimal and then calculate the result and transition to binary again, so we need a different approch

if we borrow in decimal we get 10 and addition of the place we are borrowing but in binary we get the power 2 as borrow like if it was 10 then if we borrow 1 we will be getting 1x2^1 as borrow which is 10 itself we take 11 as borrow on the place we borrowwed 
so if subtract 0001 from 1000 then we have to borrow 11 from msb to lsb so we will get 0 1 1 1 after the process as 1 1 0 - 1 will be 1 at the lsb
